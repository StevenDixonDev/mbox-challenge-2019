# All Inbox, LLC - Summer Coding Challenge 2019

Challenge Info [link](https://allinboxchallenge0619.splashthat.com/)

## The Rules 

Who is Eligible to Win

Any student enrolled in a Trilogy Boot Camp in the USA during the timeframe of June 1, 2019, to July 31, 2019. You must be current in your homework and group projects, and also be in good standing with attendance. You are not eligible if you’ve participated in any coding challenge previously hosted by All Inbox, LLC.

## Submission method

You must register via this page to confirm your interest in participating in the All Inbox Summer Coding Challenge. Upon registration, you will receive an email with details about the Challenge, including a Zip file of materials and instructions on how to submit once you are done. If you do not receive this email, please reach out to us. Please note: You will be required to submit a GitHub repo that contains your code and commit history as part of your submission.

## The Challenge

All Inbox, LLC does lots of formatting, templating, and automation of digital media, content, and marketing.  One of those mediums is email. All Inbox sends lots of emails. Millions of them. We need to reformat this email inbox file (called an mbox).  Can you help us?

You will be given an email mbox file filled with single-part email messages with a content type of text/plain. Your goal is to take this mbox file with your script and generate another mbox file with all the email messages. The new mbox file will have the emails in the same order, but with the lines of each individual message body printed in reverse order.

The email headers and properly delimited email signatures remain unchanged.

You are given a sample input and output, but we will judge your code on a larger set of inputs. You are encouraged to do your research to determine the official formatting for an “mbox file” and all of the other terms used here.

Upon registration via this landing page, you will receive an email that includes the Challenge Zip file. There are three files inside the zip file.  All are plain text formatted. Mbox_example (think of this as the “before”), mbox_example_reversed (the “after”), and mbox_full (the one you should run your code against).

## The Process 

All Inbox, LLC employees will evaluate the submissions and come to a consensus on a winner. You will be evaluated upon completion of the requirements of the challenge, code cleanliness, and formatting. All Inbox will evaluate the entries and pick a winning candidate. Candidates must be in good standing with their boot camp.

How we will notify the winner...

Once a winning candidate is chosen by All Inbox, LLC the winner will be notified by email. Some information such as mailing address might be necessary to ship the prize at that time.

## Some guidelines...

Your code should be clean and readable.  Good code is clean code.

Comments in your code are more than welcome.  Often times a properly worded variable suffices as a comment.  All Inbox is not interested in confusing, obfuscated spaghetti code. We read and write code every day, and our code base is huge. We evaluate each other’s code every single day.

You MUST submit this as a git repository.  Learning to use git is an important skill. All Inbox staff use git every single day.  It is essential for us to collaborate and merge code. Google drive links, zip files, or Drop Boxes are not acceptable for submission.

Commit early, commit often.  We want to see your code as you progress through the project.

Your GitHub/GitLab repository should have a readme file and explain what each file is and how to use them.

You should not need any external libraries to accomplish this, but if you need to use syntax sweeteners such as jQuery to make things easier and cleaner, go right ahead if it suits you.  The library you use must be clearly documented to show you used it in your readme, and why you used it.

Use a code formatter such as prettier or beautify. We encourage you to use a testing suite if you are familiar with them.  If you aren’t familiar with testing suites yet, not to worry - using one is not a requirement.
